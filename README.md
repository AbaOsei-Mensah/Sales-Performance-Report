- Who are the top-performing sales reps?
- Which product categories drive the most revenue?
- What are the most successful regions in terms of sales?

Quarterly Trend Forecast
Sales performance showed a gradual decline from January through June, marking a downward trend in the first half of 2021. A significant increase was observed in August, during the third quarter, followed by a decline in September and another spike in December. Based on the sales analysis report, it is projected that sales will experience a sharp decline in January 2022 and remain stable throughout the first quarter of the year.

### Recommendations

Leverage Top Performers: Recognize and learn from top sales reps like Rafaelita Blaksland to boost team-wide performance.

Invest in High-Performing Regions: Focus resources on India and Canada, where sales are highest, and replicate successful strategies elsewhere.

Promote Best-Selling Products: Prioritize marketing and innovation around Bars, the highest-earning product category.

Stabilize Sales Across Quarters: Launch targeted Q1 promotions to offset the expected drop and prepare for seasonal spikes in August and December.

Monitor and Adapt: Use real-time analytics to track trends and adjust strategies quickly.

### Limitations 

The analysis lacks context on external factors like marketing efforts, customer behavior, or market conditions, making it difficult to fully understand the reasons behind sales trends.

Additionally, some sales representatives, including the top-performing salesperson Rafaelita Blaksland, were not initially assigned to any sales team. To address this, these individuals were programmatically assigned to the 'Special' sales team using DAX functions.
Also some sales person including the best forming sales person Rafelita were not allocated to sales teams hence these persons were allocated to the sales team 'special' using DAX
